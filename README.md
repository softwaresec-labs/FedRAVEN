# FedREVAN
Real-time Detection of Vulnerable Android Source Code through Federated Neural Network with XAI

Android applications are rapidly published and updated due to continuous and increasing user demands, and rapidly changing user needs. 
Due to the rushed development cycles, you may focus more on the applications' functionalities than the security and source code vulnerabilities. 
This may due to the lack of automated mechanisms to assist app developers in mitigating the vulnerabilities. 

FedREVAN plugin can be integrated with the Android Studio to support you for real-time source code vulnerability mitigation. 
The plugin can provide the vulnerability status of a given source code line, which you are currently working on. 
A well-trained, highly accurate and efficient federated artificial neural network model runs in the backend of FedREVAN. It can detect source code vulnerabilities, and their CWE categories with 95% accuracy. 
Explainable AI techniques are also employed to provide the source code vulnerability prediction probabilities of each word.
